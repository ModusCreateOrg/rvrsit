Everything is inside the silkjs/ directory.  All the other files are not
used by the SilkJS version.

After checking out SilkJS and building it, you should do:
(from the SilkJS directory)
sudo ./silkjs Install.js

This puts silkjs in /usr/local/bin, httpd-silkjs in /usr/local/bin, and
include type files in /usr/share/silkjs

To run the server:
cd othello/silkjs
httpd-silkjs ./othello.js

Point your browser at http://localhost:9090/debug.html
